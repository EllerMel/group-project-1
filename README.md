# Group Project 1

1. Designate one person from your group to fork this repo.
2. Clone repo to Sites
2. CD into cloned repo and run `vue create myrepo`.
3. CD into new subfolder, and move the .gitignore to the top level and remove the extra .git from the subfolder (the only .git file should be in your original cloned reop)
4. `git add, commit, push`
5. Install bootstrap and any other files w/justin


Now everyong in the group can now clone that repo and work on their own development branch for their stories.
- Make a new branch for each story you work on (use some kind of shortened name for the branch based on the story you work on; no spaces in github branch names)
- Communicate with your team for completed stories, pull requests (merging branches, and pulling the new master into your working branch), and especially for merge conflicts.
